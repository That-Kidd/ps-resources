# How to get the account ID
<sub> This is not your email and password. There is another way but this way is faster </sub>

  1. On your PS4 go to `Settings`>`Application Saved Data Management`>`Saved Data in System Storage`>`Copy to USB Storage Device` and copy any save game to your USB
    - It can be game, make sure to copy a save not just a profile or settings.
    
  2. Plug your USB into your computer and you should see a folder called `PS4`. Open it
  
  3. Inside the folder you should see another folder called `SAVEDATA`. Open it
  
  4. Inside this folder is another folder named `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
  
 Congratulations on getting your Account ID!
