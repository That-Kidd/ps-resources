# How to Encrypt saves using HTOS


1. Start the command with ‘/encrypt’ it will give you a few different options such as upload individually, upload sce_sys, and account id. 

```
Upload individually: upload file by file when asked or all at once 
Sce_sys upload:      include sce_sys when encrypting
Account id:        who you want the save signed to after encryption. 
```

<sub>If you did not resign your save during the encryption process, you will have to resign it to your account afterwards.</sub>
